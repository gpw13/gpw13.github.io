# GPW13

## R Package Ecosystem

To implement the Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13) methods (see [Background](#Background) for more details), a suite of R packages has been developed by WHO.

The ecosystem
  - Provides functionality for common tasks related to the Billions and the GPW13 methods
  - Simplifies sharing code
  - Allows for detailed documentation and version control of code and outputs
  - Accessible to individual users
  - Usable within a pipeline

It is complemented by a data pipeline.

## Background

The Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13) defines WHO's strategy for the five-year period 2019-2023. The GPW 13 Results Framework was developed to track the measurable impact of WHO on people's health at the country level. It includes three components: impact measurement; the output scorecard; and qualitative country case studies. More information on the GPW 13 Results Framework can be found online [here](https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do/thirteenth-general-programme-of-work-2019---2023).


### Impact Measurement

Impact measurement is based on the Sustainable Development Goals and measures progress at three levels:

  - 46 outcome indicators encompassing a comprehensive range health topics;
  - The Triple Billion targets; and
  - Healthy life expectancy (HALE).

### The Triple Billion targets

Improve the health of billions by 2023:

  - One billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage.
  - One billion more people better protected from health emergencies.
  - One billion more people enjoying better health and well-being.

### The Triple Billion dashboard

An interactive and dynamic tool to track progress and deliver impact towards the Triple Billion targets and Sustainable Development Goals at country, region and global levels. WHO strives to incorporate new data into the dashboard as it becomes available, and estimates/projections will change in response to these data. The dashboard has been developed through consultation with countries, and will continue to be updated and improved based on the feedback we receive.

The dashboard can be found [here](https://portal.who.int/triplebillions/).
